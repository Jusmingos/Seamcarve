Handin: Final

Design Choices:
       In this program I wrote three helper methods in addition to findLowestCostSeam(): fillColors(),
       which takes in a colors array and fills it with the color values of the pixels;
       fillVals(), which takes in a colors array, an image width and a vals array and fills the vals array
       with the importance values of the pixels; findMin(), which takes in the top row of the cost array and
       returns the index of the smallest element in the top row; fillArrays(), which takes in width, vals, costs and dirs
       to fill the costs and dirs 2D arrays.

Known Bugs: None
